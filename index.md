<hr />

I am now a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Biostatistics and Bioformatics at Emory University, working with
Professor <a href="http://www.haowulab.org">Hao Wu</a>. My
research interests focus on statistical modeling for large scale genomic data. In addition to methodology research,
I'm also interested in collaboration projects with Biologist. My collaboration project involves the study of cancer
and Alzheimer's disease. 
<!-- My work has been published on influential journals such as Nature Method, Nature Genetics, Genome Research, and Genome Biology. We developed a number of open source software tools. We have contributed several packages freely available on Bioconductor, with over 30,000 combined downloads annually. See [Publication](http://www.haowulab.org//pages/pubs.html) and [Software](http://www.haowulab.org//pages/software.html) pages for detail.

<p>
I joined the department in 2017 after obtaining my M.S.
degree in Operational Research from the
<a href="http://english.amss.cas.cn/">Academy of Methametics and Systems Science at Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>,
under the guidances of professor
<a href="http://www.zhanglab-amss.org/homepage/">Shihua Zhang</a>.
I will join Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen as a tenure-track assistant professor in November 2022.
