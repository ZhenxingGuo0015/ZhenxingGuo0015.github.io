### Bio

I received my Ph.D. in <a href = "https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html">Biostatistics</a> in July 2022 from the Department of Biostatistics and Bioformatics at 
<a href="https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html">Emory University</a>, under the guidance of 
Professor <a href="http://www.haowulab.org">Hao Wu</a>. My research interests focus on the development of statistically principled and computationally efficient methd and tools for the analysis of biomedical data, in particular, omics data. I have been working on RNA methylation data during my PhD study, where I developed an efficient R/Bioconductor package <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TRESS.html">TRESS</a> to detect m6A methylation (the most abundant RNA modification), and differential m6A methylation. 
In addition to methodology research,
I'm also interested in collaboration projects with clinician and Biologist. My collaboration project involves the study of asthma, cancer
and Alzheimer's disease. 

<p>
Before my PhD at Emory, I received a BS in <a href="http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/">Applied Mathematics</a> in 2014 from Hunan University, and a MS in <a href="http://english.amss.cas.cn/">Operational Research</a> in 2017 from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science at <a href="https://english.cas.cn/">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>, under the guidance of Professor <a href="http://www.zhanglab-amss.org/homepage/">Shihua Zhang</a>.
