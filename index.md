<hr />


I am now a Ph.D. candidate of the Department of Biostatistics and Bioformatics at Emory University, working with
Professor <a href="http://www.haowulab.org">Hao Wu</a>. My
research interests focus on statistical modeling for large scale genomic data. In addition to methodology research,
I'm also interested in collaboration projects with Biologist. My collaboration project involves the study of cancer
and Alzheimer's disease. 

<p>
Zhenxing received a BS in [applied mathematics](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/)
in 2014 from the
Hunan Univeristy;Changsha China, and a M.S in [operational research](http://english.amss.cas.cn/) in 2017 from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science at Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; her M.S. advisor was Professor [Shihua Zhang](http://www.zhanglab-amss.org/homepage/). She obtained her PhD in [Biostatistics]() in 2022 from the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Emory University; her PhD advisor is Professor [Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/). She will join the [School of Data Science, Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/taxonomy/term/48) as a tenure-track assistant professor in the fall of 2022.
